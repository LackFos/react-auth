# React Auth

## Overview

Welcome to React Auth! This project uses the following libraries:

- [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest): For managing async state in React apps.
- [React Router Dom](https://reactrouter.com/en/main): For handling routes.

## Purpose

This project provides an example of implementing authentication in React apps. Feel free to explore the code to learn how it's done. I didn't write much here because, well, I'm a bit lazy to write docs. Just a heads up: my thoughts on authentication might be a bit outdated. Make sure to do your own research too, okay?

Enjoy digging into the code!
